		Dialogue: {
			Dorira: {
				GoblinDialogue: I came here because I heard the anomalies in this dimension are very bad, {0}'s money sucking service is DEFINITELY one.
				DemolitionistDialogue: When I go monster hunting, I will always buy {0}'s explosives from now on. Why I need bombs for hunting? You think a raw wall will do the trick? PAH!
				GenericDialogue1: When you are going to the Underworld, don't run into a wall.
				GenericDialogue2: serglhw3o85zhp35ognpügd1312mfghödfdlhgftzjmdzinhwüß046ihn
				GenericDialogue3: I've had a weird feeling since a while, its as if everything could go mad any second...
				GenericDialogue4: Do you know this mod named Awakened Light? Yeah, me neither.
				GenericDialogue5: Oh yeah, so there was once this guy who was incredible racist against Goblins. Well I killed him, no hesitation. Okay actually I just simply didn't like that guy.
				GenericDialogue6: Insert something very interesting here
				GenericDialogue7: There is fungus among us.
				GenericDialogue8: I suddenly have the urge to write an entire essay about why people should stop making flying pigs.
				GenericDialogue9: Keep your safe safe.
				GenericDialogue10: Do you ever want to start a conversation but everything that comes out is just "the"?
				GenericDialogue11: The best game design choice ever made was giving the desert furry a secret one-shot attack.
				GenericDialogue12: I hope I can fix everything somehow...
				GenericHardmodeDialogue1: Hey just between us two, if you happen to possess a sword made of fish, throw it into some weird liquid. ;)
				YttriumDialogue: Crabs have grown in power, soon they will oberthrow us and become the dominant species. No but seriously, you should check out those crabs at the ocean.
				MushroomDialogue: I had a dream where you showed me all of these alchemy mushrooms in a glowing mushroom biome while shopping with me. I think you did that after defeating a weird stone construct powered by solar energy.
				SerpentAscendDialogue: I heard that in its dying moments, a serpent will ascend to become a wyrm. Maybe it's an act of mercy, an apology from their ancestors for stripping them of their primal forms. Truth or not, it is a beautiful thought to hold onto.
				#Below is help dialogue
				ColdHellHelp: The more you travel west in the Underworld, the more I get the feeling the temperature starts sinking, what could this mean?
				DimensiumHelp: You can find Dimensium by doing many different things. Killing, mining, fishing, and so much more.
				KingsCapHelp: You know that mushroom forest nearby? If you wait long enough, you may find a mushroom that is larger than the others. You may wake it up using a unique fungus only found in that forest.
				TouchGrassHelp: Go outside
				#Below is quest dialogue
				FlashQuestStart: Hey, I thought you could help me out right now, I need some objects for something important. If you were to bring me 10 Frost Scales, 2 mice and around 5 Dimensium that would be great. What do I need them for? Well... I can tell you, if you bring me these things.
				FlashQuestClear: Thank you so much! With this I could create a magic construct in the image of one I miss alot. Here, you can take him with you for a while, he might be a nice little support.
				#Below is tpose dialogue
				Tpose: He seems to be experiencing something real funky.

				GenericDialogue1: Hello, welcome, trade rarities?

				BloodMoonDialogue: ...
				SlimeRainDialogue: Yum yum, gelatine heaven!
				ShadeItemDialogue: Shadow, I can smell it, say hello to him for Taraha.
				SmileyDialogue: The king, empty, alone, withering...

				FatherDialogue: DAD, GET THE HELL AWAY FROM HERE!
				UncleDialogue: OMG uncle, hi!
				ClothTruffleDialogue: So, sometimes I see {0} sneak into {0}’s house at night. You think there is something going on between them?
				AldinDialogue: I once met this awesome mushroom enthusiast, he was pretty chill and cool. He told me he wanted to find 7 mushrooms to do whatever, probably bend space-time or something. Anyways, he disappeared without a trace and I have not seen him since then.
				RocketDialogue: So I talked to this guy once who really seemed to like mushrooms, it was a nice conversation until he mentioned he preferred my dad over my uncle. I was like “DUDE HOW?” and he kept going with how awesome he is. I told him to shroom himself and left him alone with a moldy one, hope the smell unrots his brain.
				GenericDialogue1: My uncle is so cool, unlike my boring as hell dad. He EVEN GLOWS, can you believe that??
				GenericDialogue2: Hey between you and me, I'm pretty sure my uncle is a hallucinogenic!!
				GenericDialogue3: I had this friend of mine named Malcolm, I got several awesome mushrooms from him, but then he suddenly stopped, saying something like "I have to be a better person". Bleh… weirdo.
				GenericDialogue4: Dem mushromz hit hart todai
				GenericDialogue6: Sometimes my dad was so annoying that I told him to finally go get some milk.
				GenericDialogue7: I heard there is a kingdom full of mushroom people, but it’s not ruled by a mushroom, do you think it’s real?
				GenericDialogue8: Yo, would be awesome if you were to meet my uncle. If you bring me like, 5 of these Hovercaps, I'm going to give you something that will definitely draw his attention. Why I need those caps? Well I find it really funny to use them as a frisbee.
				GenericDialogue8B: So, my uncle thought you killed my dad and stole the ring. That is very unfortunate, but tell ME. Did you two have an epic fight? Did you? Did you?
				#Below is Alch Mushroom dialogue
				TradeSuccess1: Yo awesome, take these for your work.
				TradeSuccess2: Thanks, my other contact will really appreciate these!
				TradeFail1: Idk if you understand the concept of trading but you do indeed need to give me something of interest, this isn’t god damn donation central.
				TradeFail2: Hello? You understand me? You need to give thingie so I give thingie. So GET your ass out unless you need something important.
				MadnessTrade: HOLY COW! I have no idea where you found this but these mushrooms are EXTREMELY rare. There is only one species in my possession that I could give you for such a beauty.
				DyeItemTrade: Oh thanks, how did you know I was hungry?
				GlowTrade: Alright, here ya go bro. I stole this from my dad to sell it but apperantly it belongs to my uncle. Try to give it back so you two can get to know eachother!
				#Below is first time talk dialogue
				FirstTalk1: I saw you gave my dad a good thrashing, so I guess you’re cool.
				FirstTalk2: Yes bro, you don’t know how much I hate that guy, hope he went to cry in a corner. I’m Deadly Dappercap btw, the deadliest fungus in town, I love to get around and gather some really funky shrooms. Let’s say you bring me some valuable things and I'll give you some of them. But if anyone asks, they aren’t from me, understood?
				FirstTalk3: Good to know. So you bring me rare fauna and I give you some pricey fungi, that or you buy them for a Dapper deluxe price.
				#Below is box dialogue
				Box: Ey, go away, you are going to reveal my location if you keep talking to me. I will not come out until I know its safe again.
				#Below is reality shroom event dialogue
				AldinGrab1: I don't even know this mushroom, thats how rare it must be. It makes me feel weird though, so I'm not sure if I want this. WHAT THE HECK!?
				AldinGrab2: Well... that was something I guess.
