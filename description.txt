Awakened Light is a growing lore-based content mod that aims to go with a multidimensional and outer gods thematic.
This mod also readds and reworks the old Ancients Awakened mod and integrates it into its lore. [Note that most of the AA content will come next update]
You may see many familiar faces known from Ancients Awakened as well as new characters alongside them.

Multiplayer support was attempted but ultimately not pursued any further, this means its not advised to play together. Support will likely be added in the future.

The mod currently adds:

- 100+ Weapons
- 35 Accessories
- 4 Armor Sets
- 6 Pets
- Several Vanity Items
- 25 Enemies & Critters
- 8 Bosses
- 6 Town NPCs
- 1 Town Pet
- 6 Biomes
- 1 Event
- Several pieces of placeable furniture
- Boss Souls acting as lore items with more uses added later.
- Some changes to vanilla enemy lootpools and recipes for normally not craftable items.

I'm not really the best coder currently and have some bigger planned content, so help, even if it's just helping me improve, is greatly appreciated.
If you are a coder, spriter or musician and you are interested in this mod and want to help, join the mods discord server
Or just do it for news I guess, lol.
