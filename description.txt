The Multidimension Mod is a small content mod rn but will grow bigger as I gain experience and team members.

Dimensions arent included yet but there are several planned that will be implemented in the future.
Just telling you so you arent confused by the mods name, the mod is just named after a personal project.

The mod currently adds:

- 57 Weapons
- 25 Accessories
- 13 Placeable furniture items
- 12 Potions
- 2 Pets
- 4 Vanity Items
- 11 Enemies
- 1 Boss
- Boss Souls acting as lore items.
- Some changes to vanilla enemy lootpools and recipes for normally not craftable items.

I'm not really the best coder and have some bigger planned content,
so if you are a coder, spriter or musician (preferred coder or music person) and you are interested in my work and want to help me, join my discord server
Or just do it for news ig, lol.
