The Multidimension Mod is a small content mod rn but will grow bigger as I gain experience and team members.

Dimensions arent included yet but there are several planned that will be implemented in the future.
Just telling you so you arent confused by the mods name, the mod is just named after a personal project.

The mod currently adds:

- 100+ Weapons
- 32 Accessories
- 2 Armor Sets
- 2 Pets
- 6 Vanity Items
- 11 Enemies
- 1 Boss and 2 minibosses
- 1 Town NPC
- 1 Biome
       Frozen Underworld: A frozen solid version of the underworld that takes up almost half of the regular one.
- A good variety of placeable furniture
- Boss Souls acting as lore items, can be crafted into boss soul weapons.
- Some changes to vanilla enemy lootpools and recipes for normally not craftable items.
- A transmutation system, allowing the player to convert materials into their counterpart or even awakening a items hidden power.
- Dozens of scrapped items, enemies and even bosses from Ancients Awakened make their return in this mod.

I'm not really the best coder and have some bigger planned content.
