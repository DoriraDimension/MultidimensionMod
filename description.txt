The Multidimension Mod is a small content mod rn but will grow bigger as I gain experience and team members.

Dimensions arent included yet but there are several planned that will be implemented in the future.
Just telling you so you arent confused by the mods name, the mod is just named after a personal project.

The mod currently adds:

- 75 Weapons
- 39 Accessories
- 1 Armor Set
- 13 Placeable furniture items
- 12 Potions
- 2 Pets
- 6 Vanity Items
- 11 Enemies
- 1 Boss
- 1 Town NPC
- 1 unfisnished biome
- Boss Souls acting as lore items, can be crafted into boss soul weapons.
- Some changes to vanilla enemy lootpools and recipes for normally not craftable items.
- A transmutation system, allowing the player to convert materials into their counterpart or even awakening a items hidden power.
- Dozens of items, enemies and even bosses from the old version of the Ancients Awakened mod, giving them another chance to shine, since they are removed from the new version.
