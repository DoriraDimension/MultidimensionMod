The Multidimension is a growing content mod that aims to go with a multidimensional and outer gods thematic.

Dimensions arent included yet but there are several planned to be implemented in the future.

The mod currently adds:

- 100+ Weapons
- 32 Accessories
- 4 Armor Sets
- 3 Pets
- 6 Vanity Items
- 11 Enemies
- 2 Bosses and 2 minibosses
- 2 NPCs
- 1 Town Pet
- 1 Biome
- 1 Event
- A good variety of placeable furniture
- Boss Souls acting as lore items with more uses added later.
- Some changes to vanilla enemy lootpools and recipes for normally not craftable items.
- Dozens of scrapped items, enemies and even bosses from Ancients Awakened make their return in this mod.

I'm not really the best coder currently and have some bigger planned content, so help, even if its just helping me improve, is greatly appreciated.
If you are a coder, spriter or musician and you are interested in this mod and want to help, join the mods discord server
