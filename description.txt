Awakened Light is a growing lore-based content mod that aims to go with a multidimensional and outer gods thematic.
This mod also readds and reworks the old Ancients Awakened mod and integrates it into its lore.

The mod currently adds:

- 100+ Weapons
- 32 Accessories
- 3 Armor Sets
- 3 Pets
- Several Vanity Items
- 18 Enemies
- 1 Boss
- 2 Town NPCs
- 1 Town Pet
- 1 Biome
- 1 Event
- Several pieces of placeable furniture
- Boss Souls acting as lore items with more uses added later.
- Some changes to vanilla enemy lootpools and recipes for normally not craftable items.
- A reworked version of the old Ancients Awakened mod. [Note that the mod is added and reworked over the course of several updates]

I'm not really the best coder currently and have some bigger planned content, so help, even if it's just helping me improve, is greatly appreciated.
